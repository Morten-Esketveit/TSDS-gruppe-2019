% Idea: How would a geographically confined natural disaster affect the network (e.g. if it was in Atlanta?). 
% Transmission of delays?

% Motivation of the study: why you focus on this particular issue
% Hypothesis and objective(s)
% Description of the background (theoretical and empirical) that lead you to propose the hypothesis
% Approach and summary of results: what is your strategy to check the hypothesis and the main result
% Structure of the paper
Firstly we characterize the air transport sector as a network, with airports as nodes and flights as edges. Secondly, we combine results from this network-analysis with spatial and other data and attempt to predict prices on flights.
